# NMT-LSTM-EN_TR
- This model is acquired and changed from DeepLearning.AI - Week 1 (Neural Machine Translation) course assignment-1.
 
Implementing an encoder-decoder system with attention (Only RNN with LSTMs not the best for long sentences). Building the NMT model from scratch using Tensorflow. Generating translations using greedy and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
